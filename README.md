# Cache-Toolkits
Some basic cache mapping illustrations for education made by my students.

The purpose is to implement Direct Map (DM), Fully Associative (FA) and Set-Associative (SA) to find the status of incoming memory addresses and calculating the access time. These are suitable for computer engineering students learning the basic cache mapping algorithms.
