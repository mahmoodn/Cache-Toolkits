This is a C# implementation for cache mapping algorithms. Source and binary files are included. 
This package needs .NET core 3.1.4, so there is an installer inside the package that automatically downloads and install .NET core. The programs can save the addresses for furture uses and when you enter a number of addresses for a given mapping algorithm, you can switch to other mappings and see the differences without entering the addresses again.

This program is written by Sadra Latifaltojar
