This is a C# implementation for cache mapping algorithms. Source and binary files are included. 
This package needs .NET core 3.1.4, so there is an installer inside the package that automatically installÿ≥ .NET core. The programs can save the addresses for furture uses and when you enter a number of addresses for a given mapping algorithm, you can switch to other mappings and see the differences without entering the addresses again.

This program is written by Sadra Latifaltojar
